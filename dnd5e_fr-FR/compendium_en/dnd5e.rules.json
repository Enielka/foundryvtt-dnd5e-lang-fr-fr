These stat blocks can be used to represent both human and nonhuman NPCs.</p>\n<h2>Customizing NPCs</h2>\n<p>There are many easy ways to customize the NPCs in this appendix for your home campaign.</p>\n<p><strong>Racial Traits. </strong>You can add racial traits to an NPC. For example, a halfling druid might have a speed of 25 feet and the @Compendium[dnd5e.races.LOMdcNAGWh5xpfm4]{Lucky} trait. Adding racial traits to an NPC doesn’t alter its challenge rating. For more on racial traits, see the Player’s Handbook.</p>\n<p><strong>Spell Swaps. </strong>One way to customize an NPC spellcaster is to replace one or more of its spells. You can substitute any spell on the NPC’s spell list with a different spell of the same level from the same spell list. Swapping spells in this manner doesn’t alter an NPC’s challenge rating.</p>\n<p><strong>Armor and Weapon Swaps.</strong> You can upgrade or downgrade an NPC’s armor, or add or switch weapons. Adjustments to Armor Class and damage can change an NPC’s challenge rating.</p>\n<p><strong>Magic Items.</strong> The more powerful an NPC, the more likely it has one or more magic items in its possession. An archmage, for example, might have a magic staff or wand, as well as one or more potions and scrolls. Giving an NPC a potent damage-dealing magic item could alter its challenge rating.</p>\n<h2>A</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.CHEUjiYrVM9X0vIT]{Acolyte}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.B7lBOr1AahNZs4a6]{Archmage}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.EMvcuOpu7ABCmBWi]{Assassin}</p>\n<h2>B</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.n4TEv7inVUkyZviN]{Bandit}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.rb7OJt822wIO52qY]{Bandit Captain}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.kz1t6xeXVwODpYb2]{Berserker}</p>\n<h2>C</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.SqZRuJ8lt2KGJBbq]{Commoner}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.qkLNA1lKMMJpxuWg]{Cultist}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.tYfQIxCJT0WaaKmc]{Cult Fanatic}</p>\n<h2>D</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.K15Yl8JmB5iPircc]{Druid}</p>\n<h2>G</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.fsPruAIDOg4tVrgb]{Gladiator}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.E9CvDPDg5dFEpVjS]{Guard}</p>\n<h2>K</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.D5UqYD1EnTrJaMTO]{Knight}</p>\n<h2>M</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.mQnsXanewsPiV7QE]{Mage}</p>\n<h2>N</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.GlaCGcgIP6YjBjGc]{Noble}</p>\n<h2>P</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.PVD5wRdyO7iCJPs1]{Priest}</p>\n<h2>S</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.O3ABqI55Ir1du1Xa]{Scout}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.13K3XK2A3wwxVKLD]{Spy}</p>\n<h2>T</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.Cy3A0rsNMPLZozam]{Thug}</p>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.nREPw9g94Bsb9sIl]{Tribal Warrior}</p>\n<h2>V</h2>\n<p>@Compendium[dnd5e.monsters.J8xjoG4Dxb8WkHtV]{Veteran}</p>"

				"Armor": {
					"name": "Armor",
					"text": "<p>Fantasy gaming worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures, each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors supplement their armor with a shield.</p><p>The Armor table shows the cost, weight, and other properties of the common types of armor worn in fantasy gaming worlds.</p><p><strong>Armor Proficiency. </strong>Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an arm. Only those proficient in the armor's use know how to wear it effectively, however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and you can't cast spells.</p><p><strong>Armor Class (AC).</strong> Armor protects its wearer from attacks. The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Heavy Armor. </strong>Heavier armor interferes with the wearer's ability to move quickly, stealthily, and freely. If the Armor table shows “Str 13” or “Str 15” in the Strength column for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer's speed by 10 feet unless the wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score.</p><p><strong>Stealth. </strong>If the Armor table shows “Disadvantage” in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks.</p><p><strong>Shields. </strong>A shield is made from wood or metal and is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You can benefit from only one shield at a time.</p><h2>Light Armor</h2><p>Made from supple and thin materials, light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Padded. </strong>Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting.</p><p><strong>Leather. </strong>The breastplate and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible materials.</p><p><strong>Studded Leather. </strong>Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes.</p><h2>Medium Armor</h2><p>Medium armor offers more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class.</p><p><strong>Hide.</strong> This crude armor consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to create better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Shirt. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection to the wearer's upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against one another to be muffled by outer layers.</p><p><strong>Scale Mail. </strong>This armor consists of a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Breastplate. </strong>This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor provides good protection for the wearer's vital organs while leaving the wearer relatively unencumbered.</p><p><strong>Half Plate. </strong>Half plate consists of shaped metal plates that cover most of the wearer's body. It does not include leg protection beyond simple greaves that are attached with leather straps.</p><h2>Heavy Armor</h2><p>Of all the armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk.</p><p>Heavy armor doesn't let you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn't penalize you if your Dexterity modifier is negative.</p><p><strong>Ring Mail.</strong> This armor is leather armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it's usually worn only by those who can't afford better armor.</p><p><strong>Chain Mail. </strong>Made of interlocking metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes gauntlets.</p><p><strong>Splint. </strong>This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding.

					"name": "Weapons",
					"text": "<p>Your class grants proficiency in certain weapons, reflecting both the class's focus and the tools you are most likely to use. Whether you favor a longsword or a longbow, your weapon and your ability to wield it effectively can mean the difference between life and death while adventuring.</p><p>The Weapons table shows the most common weapons used in the fantasy gaming worlds, their price and weight, the damage they deal when they hit, and any special properties they possess. Every weapon is classified as either melee or ranged. A <strong>melee weapon</strong> is used to attack a target within 5 feet of you, whereas a <strong>ranged weapon</strong> is used to attack a target at a distance.</p><h2>Weapon Proficiency</h2><p>Your race, class, and feats can grant you proficiency with certain weapons or categories of weapons. The two categories are <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>martial</strong>. Most people can use simple weapons with proficiency. These weapons include clubs, maces, and other weapons often found in the hands of commoners. Martial weapons, including swords, axes, and polearms, require more specialized training to use effectively. Most warriors use martial weapons because these weapons put their fighting style and training to best use.</p><p>Proficiency with a weapon allows you to add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll for any attack you make with that weapon. If you make an attack roll using a weapon with which you lack proficiency, you do not add your proficiency bonus to the attack roll.</p><h2>Weapon Properties</h2><p>Many weapons have special properties related to their use, as shown in the Weapons table.</p><p><strong>Ammunition. </strong>You can use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a ranged attack only if you have ammunition to fire from the weapon. Each time you attack with the weapon, you expend one piece of ammunition. Drawing the ammunition from a quiver, case, or other container is part of the attack (you need a free hand to load a one-handed weapon). At the end of the battle, you can recover half your expended ammunition by taking a minute to search the battlefield.</p><p>If you use a weapon that has the ammunition property to make a melee attack, you treat the weapon as an improvised weapon (see “Improvised Weapons” later in the section). A sling must be loaded to deal any damage when used in this way</p><p><strong>Finesse. </strong>When making an attack with a finesse weapon, you use your choice of your Strength or Dexterity modifier for the attack and damage rolls. You must use the same modifier for both rolls.</p><p><strong>Heavy. </strong>Small creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls with heavy weapons. A heavy weapon's size and bulk make it too large for a Small creature to use effectively.</p><p><strong>Light. </strong>A light weapon is small and easy to handle, making it ideal for use when fighting with two weapons.</p><p><strong>Loading. </strong>Because of the time required to load this weapon, you can fire only one piece of ammunition from it when you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to fire it, regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><p><strong>Range.</strong> A weapon that can be used to make a ranged attack has a range in parentheses after the ammunition or thrown property. The range lists two numbers. The first is the weapon's normal range in feet, and the second indicates the weapon's long range. When attacking a target beyond normal range, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. You can't attack a target beyond the weapon's long range.</p><p><strong>Reach. </strong>This weapon adds 5 feet to your reach when you attack with it, as well as when determining your reach for opportunity attacks with it.</p><p><strong>Special. </strong>A weapon with the special property has unusual rules governing its use, explained in the weapon's description (see “Special Weapons” later in this section).</p><p><strong>Thrown. </strong>If a weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon to make a ranged attack. If the weapon is a melee weapon, you use the same ability modifier for that attack roll and damage roll that you would use for a melee attack with the weapon. For example, if you throw a handaxe, you use your Strength, but if you throw a dagger, you can use either your Strength or your Dexterity, since the dagger has the finesse property.</p><p><strong>Two-Handed. </strong>This weapon requires two hands when you attack with it.</p><p><strong>Versatile. </strong>This weapon can be used with one or two hands. A damage value in parentheses appears with the property—the damage when the weapon is used with two hands to make a melee attack.</p><h3>Improvised Weapons</h3><p>Sometimes characters don't have their weapons and have to attack with whatever is at hand. An improvised weapon includes any object you can wield in one or two hands, such as broken glass, a table leg, a frying pan, a wagon wheel, or a dead goblin.</p><p>Often, an improvised weapon is similar to an actual weapon and can be treated as such. For example, a table leg is akin to a club. At the GM's option, a character proficient with a weapon can use a similar object as if it were that weapon and use his or her proficiency bonus.</p><p>An object that bears no resemblance to a weapon deals 1d4 damage (the GM assigns a damage type appropriate to the object). If a character uses a ranged weapon to make a melee attack, or throws a melee weapon that does not have the thrown property, it also deals 1d4 damage. An improvised thrown weapon has a normal range of 20 feet and a long range of 60 feet.</p><h3>Silvered Weapons</h3><p>Some monsters that have immunity or resistance to nonmagical weapons are susceptible to silver weapons, so cautious adventurers invest extra coin to plate their weapons with silver. You can silver a single weapon or ten pieces of ammunition for 100 gp. This cost represents not only the price of the silver, but the time and expertise needed to add silver to the weapon without making it less effective.</p><h3>Special Weapons</h3><p>Weapons with special rules are described here.</p><p><strong>Lance. </strong>You have disadvantage when you use a lance to attack a target within 5 feet of you. Also, a lance requires two hands to wield when you aren't mounted.</p><p><strong>Net. </strong>A Large or smaller creature hit by a net is restrained until it is freed. A net has no effect on creatures that are formless, or creatures that are Huge or larger. A creature can use its action to make a DC 10 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Dealing 5 slashing damage to the net (AC 10) also frees the creature without harming it, ending the effect and destroying the net.</p><p>When you use an action, bonus action, or reaction to attack with a net, you can make only one attack regardless of the number of attacks you can normally make.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption></caption><thead><tr><td>Name</td><td>Cost</td><td>Damage</td><td>Weight</td><td>Properties</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Simple Melee Weapons</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Club</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Dagger</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Greatclub</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Handaxe</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Javelin</td><td>5 sp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td>Light hammer</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Mace</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Quarterstaff</td><td>2 sp</td><td>1d6 bludgeoning</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>Sickle</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Light</td></tr><tr><td>Spear</td><td>1 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Simple Ranged Weapons</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, light</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>5 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Dart</td><td>5 cp</td><td>1d4 piercing</td><td>1/4 lb.</td><td>Finesse, thrown (range 20/60)</td></tr><tr><td>Shortbow</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 80/320), two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Sling</td><td>1 sp</td><td>1d4 bludgeoning</td><td>—</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120)</td></tr><tr><td><em>Martial Melee Weapons</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Battleaxe</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Flail</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Glaive</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greataxe</td><td>30 gp</td><td>1d12 slashing</td><td>7 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Greatsword</td><td>50 gp</td><td>2d6 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Halberd</td><td>20 gp</td><td>1d10 slashing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Lance</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d12 piercing</td><td>6 lb.</td><td>Reach, special</td></tr><tr><td>Longsword</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Maul</td><td>10 gp</td><td>2d6 bludgeoning</td><td>10 lb.</td><td>Heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Morningstar</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Pike</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Heavy, reach, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Rapier</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse</td></tr><tr><td>Scimitar</td><td>25 gp</td><td>1d6 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Shortsword</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Finesse, light</td></tr><tr><td>Trident</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>4 lb.</td><td>Thrown (range 20/60), versatile (1d8)</td></tr><tr><td>War pick</td><td>5 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Warhammer</td><td>15 gp</td><td>1d8 bludgeoning</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Versatile (1d10)</td></tr><tr><td>Whip</td><td>2 gp</td><td>1d4 slashing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Finesse, reach</td></tr><tr><td><em>Martial Ranged Weapons</em></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Blowgun</td><td>10 gp</td><td>1 piercing</td><td>1 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 25/100), loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, hand</td><td>75 gp</td><td>1d6 piercing</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 30/120), light, loading</td></tr><tr><td>Crossbow, heavy</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d10 piercing</td><td>18 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 100/400), heavy, loading, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Longbow</td><td>50 gp</td><td>1d8 piercing</td><td>2 lb.</td><td>Ammunition (range 150/600), heavy, two-handed</td></tr><tr><td>Net</td><td>1 gp</td><td>—</td><td>3 lb.</td><td>Special, thrown (range 5/15)</td></tr></tbody></table>"

					"name": "Adventuring Gear",
					"text": "<p>This section describes items that have special rules or require further explanation.</p><p><strong>Acid.</strong> As an action, you can splash the contents of this vial onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw the vial up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the acid as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 2d6 acid damage.</p><p><strong>Alchemist's Fire. </strong>This sticky, adhesive fluid ignites when exposed to air. As an action, you can throw this flask up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a creature or object, treating the alchemist's fire as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target takes 1d4 fire damage at the start of each of its turns. A creature can end this damage by using its action to make a DC 10 Dexterity check to extinguish the flames.</p><p><strong>Antitoxin. </strong>A creature that drinks this vial of liquid gains advantage on saving throws against poison for 1 hour. It confers no benefit to undead or constructs.</p><p><strong>Arcane Focus. </strong>An arcane focus is a special item— an orb, a crystal, a rod, a specially constructed staff, a wand-like length of wood, or some similar item— designed to channel the power of arcane spells. A sorcerer, warlock, or wizard can use such an item as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Ball Bearings. </strong>As an action, you can spill these tiny metal balls from their pouch to cover a level, square area that is 10 feet on a side. A creature moving across the covered area must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall prone. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Block and Tackle. </strong>A set of pulleys with a cable threaded through them and a hook to attach to objects, a block and tackle allows you to hoist up to four times the weight you can normally lift.</p><p><strong>Book. </strong>A book might contain poetry, historical accounts, information pertaining to a particular field of lore, diagrams and notes on gnomish contraptions, or just about anything else that can be represented using text or pictures. A book of spells is a spellbook (described later in this section).</p><p><strong>Caltrops. </strong>As an action, you can spread a bag of caltrops to cover a square area that is 5 feet on a side. Any creature that enters the area must succeed on a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw or stop moving this turn and take 1 piercing damage. Taking this damage reduces the creature's walking speed by 10 feet until the creature regains at least 1 hit point. A creature moving through the area at half speed doesn't need to make the save.</p><p><strong>Candle. </strong>For 1 hour, a candle sheds bright light in a 5-foot radius and dim light for an additional 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Case, Crossbow Bolt. </strong>This wooden case can hold up to twenty crossbow bolts.</p><p><strong>Case, Map or Scroll. </strong>This cylindrical leather case can hold up to ten rolled-up sheets of paper or five rolled-up sheets of parchment.</p><p><strong>Chain. </strong>A chain has 10 hit points. It can be burst with a successful DC 20 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Climber's Kit. </strong>A climber's kit includes special pitons, boot tips, gloves, and a harness. You can use the climber's kit as an action to anchor yourself; when you do, you can't fall more than 25 feet from the point where you anchored yourself, and you can't climb more than 25 feet away from that point without undoing the anchor.</p><p><strong>Component Pouch. </strong>A component pouch is a small, watertight leather belt pouch that has compartments to hold all the material components and other special items you need to cast your spells, except for those components that have a specific cost (as indicated in a spell's description).</p><p><strong>Crowbar. </strong>Using a crowbar grants advantage to Strength checks where the crowbar's leverage can be applied.</p><p><strong>Druidic Focus. </strong>A druidic focus might be a sprig of mistletoe or holly, a wand or scepter made of yew or another special wood, a staff drawn whole out of a living tree, or a totem object incorporating feathers, fur, bones, and teeth from sacred animals. A druid can use such an object as a spellcasting focus.</p><p><strong>Fishing Tackle. </strong>This kit includes a wooden rod, silken line, corkwood bobbers, steel hooks, lead sinkers, velvet lures, and narrow netting.</p><p><strong>Healer's Kit. </strong>This kit is a leather pouch containing bandages, salves, and splints. The kit has ten uses. As an action, you can expend one use of the kit to stabilize a creature that has 0 hit points, without needing to make a Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p><strong>Holy Symbol. </strong>A holy symbol is a representation of a god or pantheon. It might be an amulet depicting a symbol representing a deity, the same symbol carefully engraved or inlaid as an emblem on a shield, or a tiny box holding a fragment of a sacred relic. Appendix PH-B \"Fantasy-Historical Pantheons\" lists the symbols commonly associated with many gods in the multiverse. A cleric or paladin can use a holy symbol as a spellcasting focus. To use the symbol in this way, the caster must hold it in hand, wear it visibly, or bear it on a shield.</p><p><strong>Holy Water. </strong>As an action, you can splash the contents of this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. In either case, make a ranged attack against a target creature, treating the holy water as an improvised weapon. If the target is a fiend or undead, it takes 2d6 radiant damage. A cleric or paladin may create holy water by performing a special ritual. The ritual takes 1 hour to perform, uses 25 gp worth of powdered silver, and requires the caster to expend a 1st-level spell slot.</p><p><strong>Hunting Trap.</strong> When you use your action to set it, this trap forms a saw-toothed steel ring that snaps shut when a creature steps on a pressure plate in the center. The trap is affixed by a heavy chain to an immobile object, such as a tree or a spike driven into the ground. A creature that steps on the plate must succeed on a DC 13 Dexterity saving throw or take 1d4 piercing damage and stop moving. Thereafter, until the creature breaks free of the trap, its movement is limited by the length of the chain (typically 3 feet long). A creature can use its action to make a DC 13 Strength check, freeing itself or another creature within its reach on a success. Each failed check deals 1 piercing damage to the trapped creature.</p><p><strong>Lamp. </strong>A lamp casts bright light in a 15-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Bullseye. </strong>A bullseye lantern casts bright light in a 60-foot cone and dim light for an additional 60 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil.</p><p><strong>Lantern, Hooded. </strong>A hooded lantern casts bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. Once lit, it burns for 6 hours on a flask (1 pint) of oil. As an action, you can lower the hood, reducing the light to dim light in a 5-foot radius.</p><p><strong>Lock. </strong>A key is provided with the lock. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick this lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Your GM may decide that better locks are available for higher prices.</p><p><strong>Magnifying Glass.</strong> This lens allows a closer look at small objects. It is also useful as a substitute for flint and steel when starting fires. Lighting a fire with a magnifying glass requires light as bright as sunlight to focus, tinder to ignite, and about 5 minutes for the fire to ignite. A magnifying glass grants advantage on any ability check made to appraise or inspect an item that is small or highly detailed.</p><p><strong>Manacles. </strong>These metal restraints can bind a Small or Medium creature. Escaping the manacles requires a successful DC 20 Dexterity check. Breaking them requires a successful DC 20 Strength check. Each set of manacles comes with one key. Without the key, a creature proficient with thieves' tools can pick the manacles' lock with a successful DC 15 Dexterity check. Manacles have 15 hit points.</p><p><strong>Mess Kit. </strong>This tin box contains a cup and simple cutlery. The box clamps together, and one side can be used as a cooking pan and the other as a plate or shallow bowl.</p><p><strong>Oil. </strong>Oil usually comes in a clay flask that holds 1 pint. As an action, you can splash the oil in this flask onto a creature within 5 feet of you or throw it up to 20 feet, shattering it on impact. Make a ranged attack against a target creature or object, treating the oil as an improvised weapon. On a hit, the target is covered in oil. If the target takes any fire damage before the oil dries (after 1 minute), the target takes an additional 5 fire damage from the burning oil. You can also pour a flask of oil on the ground to cover a 5-foot-square area, provided that the surface is level. If lit, the oil burns for 2 rounds and deals 5 fire damage to any creature that enters the area or ends its turn in the area. A creature can take this damage only once per turn.</p><p><strong>Poison, Basic.</strong> You can use the poison in this vial to coat one slashing or piercing weapon or up to three pieces of ammunition. Applying the poison takes an action. A creature hit by the poisoned weapon or ammunition must make a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or take 1d4 poison damage. Once applied, the poison retains potency for 1 minute before drying.</p><p><strong>Potion of Healing. </strong>A character who drinks the magical red fluid in this vial regains 2d4 + 2 hit points. Drinking or administering a potion takes an action.</p><p><strong>Pouch. </strong>A cloth or leather pouch can hold up to 20 sling bullets or 50 blowgun needles, among other things. A compartmentalized pouch for holding spell components is called a component pouch (described earlier in this section).</p><p><strong>Quiver.</strong> A quiver can hold up to 20 arrows.</p><p><strong>Ram, Portable. </strong>You can use a portable ram to break down doors. When doing so, you gain a +4 bonus on the Strength check. One other character can help you use the ram, giving you advantage on this check.</p><p><strong>Rations. </strong>Rations consist of dry foods suitable for extended travel, including jerky, dried fruit, hardtack, and nuts.</p><p><strong>Rope.</strong> Rope, whether made of hemp or silk, has 2 hit points and can be burst with a DC 17 Strength check.</p><p><strong>Scale, Merchant's. </strong>A scale includes a small balance, pans, and a suitable assortment of weights up to 2 pounds. With it, you can measure the exact weight of small objects, such as raw precious metals or trade goods, to help determine their worth.</p><p><strong>Spellbook.</strong> Essential for wizards, a spellbook is a leather-bound tome with 100 blank vellum pages suitable for recording spells.</p><p><strong>Spyglass.</strong> Objects viewed through a spyglass are magnified to twice their size.</p><p><strong>Tent. </strong>A simple and portable canvas shelter, a tent sleeps two.</p><p><strong>Tinderbox. </strong>This small container holds flint, fire steel, and tinder (usually dry cloth soaked in light oil) used to kindle a fire. Using it to light a torch—or anything else with abundant, exposed fuel—takes an action. Lighting any other fire takes 1 minute.</p><p><strong>Torch.</strong> A torch burns for 1 hour, providing bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20 feet. If you make a melee attack with a burning torch and hit, it deals 1 fire damage.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Adventuring

If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying capacity together.</p><p>Mounts other than those listed here are available in fantasy gaming worlds, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity, or negotiating with the mount itself.</p><p><strong>Barding.</strong> Barding is armor designed to protect an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor table can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much.</p><p><strong>Saddles.</strong> A military saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle. It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted.

				"Expenses": {
					"name": "Expenses",
					"text": "<p>When not descending into the depths of the earth, exploring ruins for lost treasures, or waging war against the encroaching darkness, adventurers face more mundane realities. Even in a fantastical world, people require basic necessities such as shelter, sustenance, and clothing. These things cost money, although some lifestyles cost more than others.</p><h2>Lifestyle Expenses</h2><p>Lifestyle expenses provide you with a simple way to account for the cost of living in a fantasy world. They cover your accommodations, food and drink, and all your other necessities. Furthermore, expenses cover the cost of maintaining your equipment so you can be ready when adventure next calls.</p><p>At the start of each week or month (your choice), choose a lifestyle from the Expenses table and pay the price to sustain that lifestyle. The prices listed are per day, so if you wish to calculate the cost of your chosen lifestyle over a thirty-day period, multiply the listed price by 30. Your lifestyle might change from one period to the next, based on the funds you have at your disposal, or you might maintain the same lifestyle throughout your character’s career.</p><p>Your lifestyle choice can have consequences. Maintaining a wealthy lifestyle might help you make contacts with the rich and powerful, though you run the risk of attracting thieves. Likewise, living frugally might help you avoid criminals, but you are unlikely to make powerful connections.</p><table><caption><h4>Lifestyle Expenses</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Lifestyle</td><td>Price/Day</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Wretched</td><td>—</td></tr><tr><td>Squalid</td><td>1 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>1 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>4 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>10 gp minimum</td></tr></tbody></table><p><strong>Wretched.</strong> You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.</p><p><strong>Squalid. </strong>You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment, in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as exiles, or suffer from disease.</p><p><strong>Poor.</strong> A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime, and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers, peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.</p><p><strong>Modest. </strong>A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don’t go hungry or thirsty, and your living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and the like.</p><p><strong>Comfortable. </strong>Choosing a comfortable lifestyle means that you can afford nicer clothing and can easily maintain your equipment. You live in a small cottage in a middle-class neighborhood or in a private room at a fine inn. You associate with merchants, skilled tradespeople, and military officers.</p><p><strong>Wealthy.</strong> Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses. You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.</p><p><strong>Aristocratic. </strong>You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians, guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.</p><hr /><h4>Self-Sufficiency</h4><p>The expenses and lifestyles described here assume that you are spending your time between adventures in town, availing yourself of whatever services you can afford—paying for food and shelter, paying townspeople to sharpen your sword and repair your armor, and so on. Some characters, though, might prefer to spend their time away from civilization, sustaining themselves in the wild by hunting, foraging, and repairing their own gear.</p><p>Maintaining this kind of lifestyle doesn’t require you to spend any coin, but it is time-consuming. If you spend your time between adventures practicing a profession, you can eke out the equivalent of a poor lifestyle. Proficiency in the Survival skill lets you live at the equivalent of a comfortable lifestyle.</p><hr /><h2>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h2><p>The Food, Drink, and Lodging table gives prices for individual food items and a single night’s lodging. These prices are included in your total lifestyle expenses.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Food, Drink, and Lodging</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Item</td><td>Cost</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Ale</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Gallon</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Mug</td><td>4 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Banquet (per person)</td><td>10 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Bread, loaf</td><td>2 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Cheese, hunk</td><td>1 sp</td></tr><tr><td><em>Inn stay (per day)</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Squalid</td><td>7 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>1 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>5 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>8 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>4 gp</td></tr><tr><td><em>Meals (per day)</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Squalid</td><td>3 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Poor</td><td>6 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Modest</td><td>3 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Comfortable</td><td>5 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Wealthy</td><td>8 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Aristocratic</td><td>2 gp</td></tr><tr><td>Meat, chunk</td><td>3 sp</td></tr><tr><td><em>Wine</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Common (pitcher)</td><td>2 sp</td></tr><tr><td>Fine (bottle)</td><td>10 gp</td></tr></tbody></table><h2>Services</h2><p>Adventurers can pay nonplayer characters to assist them or act on their behalf in a variety of circumstances. Most such hirelings have fairly ordinary skills, while others are masters of a craft or art, and a few are experts with specialized adventuring skills.</p><p>Some of the most basic types of hirelings appear on the Services table. Other common hirelings include any of the wide variety of people who inhabit a typical town or city, when the adventurers pay them to perform a specific task. For example, a wizard might pay a carpenter to construct an elaborate chest (and its miniature replica) for use in the secret chest spell. A fighter might commission a blacksmith to forge a special sword. A bard might pay a tailor to make exquisite clothing for an upcoming performance in front of the duke.</p><p>Other hirelings provide more expert or dangerous services. Mercenary soldiers paid to help the adventurers take on a hobgoblin army are hirelings, as are sages hired to research ancient or esoteric lore. If a high-level adventurer establishes a stronghold of some kind, he or she might hire a whole staff of servants and agents to run the place, from a castellan or steward to menial laborers to keep the stables clean. These hirelings often enjoy a long-term contract that includes a place to live within the stronghold as part of the offered compensation.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Services</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Service</td><td>Pay</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><em>Coach cab</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Between towns</td><td>3 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>Within a city</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td><em>Hireling</em></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Skilled</td><td>2 gp per day</td></tr><tr><td>Untrained</td><td>2 sp per day</td></tr><tr><td>Messenger</td><td>2 cp per mile</td></tr><tr><td>Road or gate toll</td><td>1 cp</td></tr><tr><td>Ship’s passage</td><td>1 sp per mile</td></tr></tbody></table><p>Skilled hirelings include anyone hired to perform a service that involves a proficiency (including weapon, tool, or skill): a mercenary, artisan, scribe, and so on. The pay shown is a minimum; some expert hirelings require more pay. Untrained hirelings are hired for menial work that requires no particular skill and can include laborers, porters, maids, and similar workers.</p><h2>Spellcasting Services</h2><p>People who are able to cast spells don’t fall into the category of ordinary hirelings. It might be possible to find someone willing to cast a spell in exchange for coin or favors, but it is rarely easy and no established pay rates exist. As a rule, the higher the level of the desired spell, the harder it is to find someone who can cast it and the more it costs.</p><p>Hiring someone to cast a relatively common spell of 1st or 2nd level, such as @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} or @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.3OZnNhunvRtPOQmH]{Identify}, is easy enough in a city or town, and might cost 10 to 50 gold pieces (plus the cost of any expensive material components). Finding someone able and willing to cast a higher-level spell might involve traveling to a large city, perhaps one with a university or prominent temple. Once found, the spellcaster might ask for a service instead of payment—the kind of service that only adventurers can provide, such as retrieving a rare item from a dangerous locale or traversing a monster-infested wilderness to deliver something important to a distant settlement.</p>"

				"Advantage and Disadvantage": {
					"name": "Advantage and Disadvantage",
					"text": "<p>Sometimes a special ability or spell tells you that you have advantage or disadvantage on an ability check, a saving throw, or an attack roll. When that happens, you roll a second d20 when you make the roll. Use the higher of the two rolls if you have advantage, and use the lower roll if you have disadvantage. For example, if you have disadvantage and roll a 17 and a 5, you use the 5. If you instead have advantage and roll those numbers, you use the 17.</p><p>If multiple situations affect a roll and each one grants advantage or imposes disadvantage on it, you don’t roll more than one additional d20. If two favorable situations grant advantage, for example, you still roll only one additional d20.</p><p>If circumstances cause a roll to have both advantage and disadvantage, you are considered to have neither of them, and you roll one d20. This is true even if multiple circumstances impose disadvantage and only one grants advantage or vice versa. In such a situation, you have neither advantage nor disadvantage.</p><p>When you have advantage or disadvantage and something in the game, such as the halfling’s @Compendium[dnd5e.races.LOMdcNAGWh5xpfm4]{Lucky} trait, lets you reroll the d20, you can reroll only one of the dice. You choose which one. For example, if a halfling has advantage or disadvantage on an ability check and rolls a 1 and a 13, the halfling could use the Lucky trait to reroll the 1.</p><p>You usually gain advantage or disadvantage through the use of special abilities, actions, or spells. Inspiration can also give a character advantage. The GM can also decide that circumstances influence a roll in one direction or the other and grant advantage or impose disadvantage as a result.</p>"

				"Proficiency Bonus": {
					"name": "Proficiency Bonus",
					"text": "<p>Characters have a proficiency bonus determined by level. Monsters also have this bonus, which is incorporated in their stat blocks. The bonus is used in the rules on ability checks, saving throws, and attack rolls.</p><p>Your proficiency bonus can’t be added to a single die roll or other number more than once. For example, if two different rules say you can add your proficiency bonus to a Wisdom saving throw, you nevertheless add the bonus only once when you make the save.</p><p>Occasionally, your proficiency bonus might be multiplied or divided (doubled or halved, for example) before you apply it. For example, the rogue’s @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.3sYPftQKnbbVnHrh]{Expertise} feature doubles the proficiency bonus for certain ability checks. If a circumstance suggests that your proficiency bonus applies more than once to the same roll, you still add it only once and multiply or divide it only once.</p><p>By the same token, if a feature or effect allows you to multiply your proficiency bonus when making an ability check that wouldn’t normally benefit from your proficiency bonus, you still don’t add the bonus to the check. For that check your proficiency bonus is 0, given the fact that multiplying 0 by any number is still 0. For instance, if you lack proficiency in the History skill, you gain no benefit from a feature that lets you double your proficiency bonus when you make Intelligence (History) checks.</p><p>In general, you don’t multiply your proficiency bonus for attack rolls or saving throws.

				"Ability Checks": {
					"name": "Ability Checks",
					"text": "<p>An ability check tests a character's or monster's innate talent and training in an effort to overcome a challenge. The GM calls for an ability check when a character or monster attempts an action (other than an attack) that has a chance of failure. When the outcome is uncertain, the dice determine the results.</p><p>For every ability check, the GM decides which of the six abilities is relevant to the task at hand and the difficulty of the task, represented by a Difficulty Class. The more difficult a task, the higher its DC. The Typical Difficulty Classes table shows the most common DCs.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Typical Difficulty Classes</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Task Difficulty</td><td>DC</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Very easy</td><td>5</td></tr><tr><td>Easy</td><td>10</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>15</td></tr><tr><td>Hard</td><td>20</td></tr><tr><td>Very hard</td><td>25</td></tr><tr><td>Nearly impossible</td><td>30</td></tr></tbody></table><p>To make an ability check, roll a d20 and add the relevant ability modifier. As with other d20 rolls, apply bonuses and penalties, and compare the total to the DC. If the total equals or exceeds the DC, the ability check is a success—the creature overcomes the challenge at hand. Otherwise, it's a failure, which means the character or monster makes no progress toward the objective or makes progress combined with a setback determined by the GM.</p><h2>Contests</h2><p>Sometimes one character's or monster's efforts are directly opposed to another's. This can occur when both of them are trying to do the same thing and only one can succeed, such as attempting to snatch up a magic ring that has fallen on the floor. This situation also applies when one of them is trying to prevent the other one from accomplishing a goal— for example, when a monster tries to force open a door that an adventurer is holding closed. In situations like these, the outcome is determined by a special form of ability check, called a contest.</p><p>Both participants in a contest make ability checks appropriate to their efforts. They apply all appropriate bonuses and penalties, but instead of comparing the total to a DC, they compare the totals of their two checks. The participant with the higher check total wins the contest. That character or monster either succeeds at the action or prevents the other one from succeeding.</p><p>If the contest results in a tie, the situation remains the same as it was before the contest. Thus, one contestant might win the contest by default. If two characters tie in a contest to snatch a ring off the floor, neither character grabs it. In a contest between a monster trying to open a door and an adventurer trying to keep the door closed, a tie means that the door remains shut.</p><h2>Skills</h2><p>Each ability covers a broad range of capabilities, including skills that a character or a monster can be proficient in. A skill represents a specific aspect of an ability score, and an individual's proficiency in a skill demonstrates a focus on that aspect. (A character's starting skill proficiencies are determined at character creation, and a monster's skill proficiencies appear in the monster's stat block.)</p><p>For example, a Dexterity check might reflect a character's attempt to pull off an acrobatic stunt, to palm an object, or to stay hidden. Each of these aspects of Dexterity has an associated skill: Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth, respectively. So a character who has proficiency in the Stealth skill is particularly good at Dexterity checks related to sneaking and hiding.</p><p>The skills related to each ability score are shown in the following list. (No skills are related to Constitution.) See an ability's description in the later sections of this section for examples of how to use a skill associated with an ability.</p><h3>Strength</h3><ul><li>Athletics</li></ul><h3>Dexterity</h3><ul><li>Acrobatics</li><li>Sleight of Hand</li><li>Stealth</li></ul><h3>Intelligence</h3><ul><li>Arcana</li><li>History</li><li>Investigation</li><li>Nature</li><li>Religion Wisdom</li></ul><h3>Wisdom</h3><ul><li>Animal Handling</li><li>Insight</li><li>Medicine</li><li>Perception</li><li>Survival</li></ul><h3>Charisma</h3><ul><li>Deception</li><li>Intimidation</li><li>Performance</li><li>Persuasion</li></ul><p>Sometimes, the GM might ask for an ability check using a specific skill—for example, “Make a Wisdom (Perception) check.” At other times, a player might ask the GM if proficiency in a particular skill applies to a check. In either case, proficiency in a skill means an individual can add his or her proficiency bonus to ability checks that involve that skill. Without proficiency in the skill, the individual makes a normal ability check.</p><p>For example, if a character attempts to climb up a dangerous cliff, the GM might ask for a Strength (Athletics) check. If the character is proficient in Athletics, the character's proficiency bonus is added to the Strength check. If the character lacks that proficiency, he or she just makes a Strength check.</p><h3>Variant: Skills with Different Abilities</h3><p>Normally, your proficiency in a skill applies only to a specific kind of ability check. Proficiency in Athletics, for example, usually applies to Strength checks. In some situations, though, your proficiency might reasonably apply to a different kind of check. In such cases, the GM might ask for a check using an unusual combination of ability and skill, or you might ask your GM if you can apply a proficiency to a different check. For example, if you have to swim from an offshore island to the mainland, your GM might call for a Constitution check to see if you have the stamina to make it that far. In this case, your GM might allow you to apply your proficiency in Athletics and ask for a Constitution (Athletics) check. So if you're proficient in Athletics, you apply your proficiency bonus to the Constitution check just as you would normally do for a Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, when your half-orc barbarian uses a display of raw strength to intimidate an enemy, your GM might ask for a Strength (Intimidation) check, even though Intimidation is normally associated with Charisma.</p><h2>Passive Checks</h2><p>A passive check is a special kind of ability check that doesn't involve any die rolls. Such a check can represent the average result for a task done repeatedly, such as searching for secret doors over and over again, or can be used when the GM wants to secretly determine whether the characters succeed at something without rolling dice, such as noticing a hidden monster.</p><p>Here's how to determine a character's total for a passive check:</p><p>10 + all modifiers that normally apply to the check</p><p>If the character has advantage on the check, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. The game refers to a passive check total as a <strong>score</strong>.</p><p>For example, if a 1st-level character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) score of 14.</p><p>The rules on hiding in the @UUID[.xt6tSGvU9e0vtXw6#dexterity]{Dexterity} section below rely on passive checks, as do the exploration rules.</p><h2>Working Together</h2><p>Sometimes two or more characters team up to attempt a task. The character who's leading the effort—or the one with the highest ability modifier—can make an ability check with advantage, reflecting the help provided by the other characters. In combat, this requires the Help action.</p><p>A character can only provide help if the task is one that he or she could attempt alone. For example, trying to open a lock requires proficiency with thieves' tools, so a character who lacks that proficiency can't help another character in that task. Moreover, a character can help only when two or more individuals working together would actually be productive. Some tasks, such as threading a needle, are no easier with help.</p><h3>Group Checks</h3><p>When a number of individuals are trying to accomplish something as a group, the GM might ask for a group ability check. In such a situation, the characters who are skilled at a particular task help cover those who aren't.</p><p>To make a group ability check, everyone in the group makes the ability check. If at least half the group succeeds, the whole group succeeds. Otherwise, the group fails.</p><p>Group checks don't come up very often, and they're most useful when all the characters succeed or fail as a group. For example, when adventurers are navigating a swamp, the GM might call for a group Wisdom (Survival) check to see if the characters can avoid the quicksand, sinkholes, and other natural hazards of the environment. If at least half the group succeeds, the successful characters are able to guide their companions out of danger. Otherwise, the group stumbles into one of these hazards.</p>"

				"Using Each Ability": {
					"name": "Using Each Ability",
						"text": "<p>Every task that a character or monster might attempt in the game is covered by one of the six abilities. This section explains in more detail what those abilities mean and the ways they are used in the game.</p><h2>Strength</h2><p>Strength measures bodily power, athletic training, and the extent to which you can exert raw physical force.</p><h3>Strength Checks</h3><p>A Strength check can model any attempt to lift, push, pull, or break something, to force your body through a space, or to otherwise apply brute force to a situation. The Athletics skill reflects aptitude in certain kinds of Strength checks.</p><p><strong>Athletics.</strong> Your Strength (Athletics) check covers difficult situations you encounter while climbing, jumping, or swimming. Examples include the following activities:</p><ul><li>You attempt to climb a sheer or slippery cliff, avoid hazards while scaling a wall, or cling to a surface while something is trying to knock you off.</li><li>You try to jump an unusually long distance or pull off a stunt midjump.</li><li>You struggle to swim or stay afloat in treacherous currents, storm-tossed waves, or areas of thick seaweed. Or another creature tries to push or pull you underwater or otherwise interfere with your swimming.</li></ul><p><strong>Other Strength Checks. </strong>The GM might also call for a Strength check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Force open a stuck, locked, or barred door</li><li>Break free of bonds</li><li>Push through a tunnel that is too small</li><li>Hang on to a wagon while being dragged behind it</li><li>Tip over a statue</li><li>Keep a boulder from rolling</li></ul><h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3><p>You add your Strength modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon such as a mace, a battleaxe, or a javelin. You use melee weapons to make melee attacks in handto-hand combat, and some of them can be thrown to make a ranged attack.</p><h3>Lifting and Carrying</h3><p>Your Strength score determines the amount of weight you can bear. The following terms define what you can lift or carry.</p><p><strong>Carrying Capacity. </strong>Your carrying capacity is your Strength score multiplied by 15. This is the weight (in pounds) that you can carry, which is high enough that most characters don't usually have to worry about it.</p><p><strong>Push, Drag, or Lift. </strong>You can push, drag, or lift a weight in pounds up to twice your carrying capacity (or 30 times your Strength score). While pushing or dragging weight in excess of your carrying capacity, your speed drops to 5 feet.</p><p><strong>Size and Strength. </strong>Larger creatures can bear more weight, whereas Tiny creatures can carry less. For each size category above Medium, double the creature's carrying capacity and the amount it can push, drag, or lift. For a Tiny creature, halve these weights.</p><h3>Variant: Encumbrance</h3><p>The rules for lifting and carrying are intentionally simple. Here is a variant if you are looking for more detailed rules for determining how a character is hindered by the weight of equipment. When you use this variant, ignore the Strength column of the Armor table.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 5 times your Strength score, you are <strong>encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 10 feet.</p><p>If you carry weight in excess of 10 times your Strength score, up to your maximum carrying capacity, you are instead<strong> heavily encumbered</strong>, which means your speed drops by 20 feet and you have disadvantage on ability checks, attack rolls, and saving throws that use Strength, Dexterity, or Constitution.</p><h2>Dexterity</h2><p>Dexterity measures agility, reflexes, and balance.</p><h3>Dexterity Checks</h3><p>A Dexterity check can model any attempt to move nimbly, quickly, or quietly, or to keep from falling on tricky footing. The Acrobatics, Sleight of Hand, and Stealth skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Dexterity checks.</p><p><strong>Acrobatics. </strong>Your Dexterity (Acrobatics) check covers your attempt to stay on your feet in a tricky situation, such as when you're trying to run across a sheet of ice, balance on a tightrope, or stay upright on a rocking ship's deck. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to see if you can perform acrobatic stunts, including dives, rolls, somersaults, and flips.</p><p><strong>Sleight of Hand. </strong>Whenever you attempt an act of legerdemain or manual trickery, such as planting something on someone else or concealing an object on your person, make a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check. The GM might also call for a Dexterity (Sleight of Hand) check to determine whether you can lift a coin purse off another person or slip something out of another person's pocket.</p><p><strong>Stealth. </strong>Make a Dexterity (Stealth) check when you attempt to conceal yourself from enemies, slink past guards, slip away without being noticed, or sneak up on someone without being seen or heard.</p><p><strong>Other Dexterity Checks. </strong>The GM might call for a Dexterity check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Control a heavily laden cart on a steep descent</li><li>Steer a chariot around a tight turn</li><li>Pick a lock</li><li>Disable a trap</li><li>Securely tie up a prisoner</li><li>Wriggle free of bonds</li><li>Play a stringed instrument</li><li>Craft a small or detailed object</li></ul><h3>Attack Rolls and Damage</h3><p>You add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a ranged weapon, such as a sling or a longbow. You can also add your Dexterity modifier to your attack roll and your damage roll when attacking with a melee weapon that has the finesse property, such as a dagger or a rapier.</p><h3>Armor Class</h3><p>Depending on the armor you wear, you might add some or all of your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class.</p><h3>Initiative</h3><p>At the beginning of every combat, you roll initiative by making a Dexterity check. Initiative determines the order of creatures' turns in combat.</p><hr /><h4>Hiding</h4><p>The GM decides when circumstances are appropriate for hiding. When you try to hide, make a Dexterity (Stealth) check. Until you are discovered or you stop hiding, that check's total is contested by the Wisdom (Perception) check of any creature that actively searches for signs of your presence.</p><p>You can't hide from a creature that can see you clearly, and you give away your position if you make noise, such as shouting a warning or knocking over a vase.</p><p>An invisible creature can always try to hide. Signs of its passage might still be noticed, and it does have to stay quiet.</p><p>In combat, most creatures stay alert for signs of danger all around, so if you come out of hiding and approach a creature, it usually sees you. However, under certain circumstances, the GM might allow you to stay hidden as you approach a creature that is distracted, allowing you to gain advantage on an attack roll before you are seen.</p><p><strong>Passive Perception.</strong> When you hide, there's a chance someone will notice you even if they aren't searching. To determine whether such a creature notices you, the GM compares your Dexterity (Stealth) check with that creature's passive Wisdom (Perception) score, which equals 10 + the creature's Wisdom modifier, as well as any other bonuses or penalties. If the creature has advantage, add 5. For disadvantage, subtract 5. For example, if a 1st-level character (with a proficiency bonus of +2) has a Wisdom of 15 (a +2 modifier) and proficiency in Perception, he or she has a passive Wisdom (Perception) of 14.</p><p><strong>What Can You See? </strong>One of the main factors in determining whether you can find a hidden creature or object is how well you can see in an area, which might be <strong>lightly</strong> or <strong>heavily obscured</strong>, as explained in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.aYmUMcQfSIqYWpKk.JournalEntryPage.9jyye7TeGlY4FRf3]{The Environment}.</p><hr /><h2>Constitution</h2><p>Constitution measures health, stamina, and vital force.</p><p>Constitution Checks Constitution checks are uncommon, and no skills apply to Constitution checks, because the endurance this ability represents is largely passive rather than involving a specific effort on the part of a character or monster. A Constitution check can model your attempt to push beyond normal limits, however.</p><p>The GM might call for a Constitution check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Hold your breath</li><li>March or labor for hours without rest</li><li>Go without sleep</li><li>Survive without food or water</li><li>Quaff an entire stein of ale in one go</li></ul><h3>Hit Points</h3><p>Your Constitution modifier contributes to your hit points. Typically, you add your Constitution modifier to each Hit Die you roll for your hit points.</p><p>If your Constitution modifier changes, your hit point maximum changes as well, as though you had the new modifier from 1st level. For example, if you raise your Constitution score when you reach 4th level and your Constitution modifier increases from +1 to +2, you adjust your hit point maximum as though the modifier had always been +2. So you add 3 hit points for your first three levels, and then roll your hit points for 4th level using your new modifier. Or if you're 7th level and some effect lowers your Constitution score so as to reduce your Constitution modifier by 1, your hit point maximum is reduced by 7.</p><h2>Intelligence</h2><p>Intelligence measures mental acuity, accuracy of recall, and the ability to reason.</p><h3>Intelligence Checks</h3><p>An Intelligence check comes into play when you need to draw on logic, education, memory, or deductive reasoning. The Arcana, History, Investigation, Nature, and Religion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Intelligence checks.</p><p><strong>Arcana. </strong>Your Intelligence (Arcana) check measures your ability to recall lore about spells, magic items, eldritch symbols, magical traditions, the planes of existence, and the inhabitants of those planes.</p><p><strong>History. </strong>Your Intelligence (History) check measures your ability to recall lore about historical events, legendary people, ancient kingdoms, past disputes, recent wars, and lost civilizations.</p><p><strong>Investigation.</strong> When you look around for clues and make deductions based on those clues, you make an Intelligence (Investigation) check. You might deduce the location of a hidden object, discern from the appearance of a wound what kind of weapon dealt it, or determine the weakest point in a tunnel that could cause it to collapse. Poring through ancient scrolls in search of a hidden fragment of knowledge might also call for an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><p><strong>Nature. </strong>Your Intelligence (Nature) check measures your ability to recall lore about terrain, plants and animals, the weather, and natural cycles.</p><p><strong>Religion.</strong> Your Intelligence (Religion) check measures your ability to recall lore about deities, rites and prayers, religious hierarchies, holy symbols, and the practices of secret cults.</p><p><strong>Other Intelligence Checks. </strong>The GM might call for an Intelligence check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Communicate with a creature without using words</li><li>Estimate the value of a precious item</li><li>Pull together a disguise to pass as a city guard</li><li>Forge a document</li><li>Recall lore about a craft or trade</li><li>Win a game of skill</li></ul><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Wizards use Intelligence as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h2>Wisdom</h2><p>Wisdom reflects how attuned you are to the world around you and represents perceptiveness and intuition.</p><h3>Wisdom Checks</h3><p>A Wisdom check might reflect an effort to read body language, understand someone's feelings, notice things about the environment, or care for an injured person. The Animal Handling, Insight, Medicine, Perception, and Survival skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Wisdom checks.</p><p><strong>Animal Handling. </strong>When there is any question whether you can calm down a domesticated animal, keep a mount from getting spooked, or intuit an animal's intentions, the GM might call for a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check. You also make a Wisdom (Animal Handling) check to control your mount when you attempt a risky maneuver.</p><p><strong>Insight.</strong> Your Wisdom (Insight) check decides whether you can determine the true intentions of a creature, such as when searching out a lie or predicting someone's next move. Doing so involves gleaning clues from body language, speech habits, and changes in mannerisms.</p><p><strong>Medicine.</strong> A Wisdom (Medicine) check lets you try to stabilize a dying companion or diagnose an illness.</p><p><strong>Perception.</strong> Your Wisdom (Perception) check lets you spot, hear, or otherwise detect the presence of something. It measures your general awareness of your surroundings and the keenness of your senses. For example, you might try to hear a conversation through a closed door, eavesdrop under an open window, or hear monsters moving stealthily in the forest. Or you might try to spot things that are obscured or easy to miss, whether they are orcs lying in ambush on a road, thugs hiding in the shadows of an alley, or candlelight under a closed secret door.</p><p><strong>Survival. </strong>The GM might ask you to make a Wisdom (Survival) check to follow tracks, hunt wild game, guide your group through frozen wastelands, identify signs that owlbears live nearby, predict the weather, or avoid quicksand and other natural hazards.</p><p><strong>Other Wisdom Checks. </strong>The GM might call for a Wisdom check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Get a gut feeling about what course of action to follow</li><li>Discern whether a seemingly dead or living creature is undead</li></ul><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Clerics, druids, and rangers use Wisdom as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p><h2>Charisma</h2><p>Charisma measures your ability to interact effectively with others. It includes such factors as confidence and eloquence, and it can represent a charming or commanding personality.</p><h3>Charisma Checks</h3><p>A Charisma check might arise when you try to influence or entertain others, when you try to make an impression or tell a convincing lie, or when you are navigating a tricky social situation. The Deception, Intimidation, Performance, and Persuasion skills reflect aptitude in certain kinds of Charisma checks.</p><p><strong>Deception.</strong> Your Charisma (Deception) check determines whether you can convincingly hide the truth, either verbally or through your actions. This deception can encompass everything from misleading others through ambiguity to telling outright lies. Typical situations include trying to fasttalk a guard, con a merchant, earn money through gambling, pass yourself off in a disguise, dull someone's suspicions with false assurances, or maintain a straight face while telling a blatant lie.</p><p><strong>Intimidation. </strong>When you attempt to influence someone through overt threats, hostile actions, and physical violence, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Intimidation) check. Examples include trying to pry information out of a prisoner, convincing street thugs to back down from a confrontation, or using the edge of a broken bottle to convince a sneering vizier to reconsider a decision.</p><p><strong>Performance.</strong> Your Charisma (Performance) check determines how well you can delight an audience with music, dance, acting, storytelling, or some other form of entertainment.</p><p><strong>Persuasion. </strong>When you attempt to influence someone or a group of people with tact, social graces, or good nature, the GM might ask you to make a Charisma (Persuasion) check. Typically, you use persuasion when acting in good faith, to foster friendships, make cordial requests, or exhibit proper etiquette. Examples of persuading others include convincing a chamberlain to let your party see the king, negotiating peace between warring tribes, or inspiring a crowd of townsfolk.</p><p><strong>Other Charisma Checks. </strong>The GM might call for a Charisma check when you try to accomplish tasks like the following:</p><ul><li>Find the best person to talk to for news, rumors, and gossip</li><li>Blend into a crowd to get the sense of key topics of conversation</li></ul><h3>Spellcasting Ability</h3><p>Bards, paladins, sorcerers, and warlocks use Charisma as their spellcasting ability, which helps determine the saving throw DCs of spells they cast.</p>"

You don't normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your character or monster is at risk of harm.</p><p>To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier for a Dexterity saving throw.</p><p>A saving throw can be modified by a situational bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined by the GM.</p><p>Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws.

A member of a group can be surprised even if the other members aren't.</p><h2>Initiative</h2><p>Initiative determines the order of turns during combat. When combat starts, every participant makes a Dexterity check to determine their place in the initiative order. The GM makes one roll for an entire group of identical creatures, so each member of the group acts at the same time.</p><p>The GM ranks the combatants in order from the one with the highest Dexterity check total to the one with the lowest. This is the order (called the initiative order) in which they act during each round. The initiative order remains the same from round to round.</p><p>If a tie occurs, the GM decides the order among tied GM-controlled creatures, and the players decide the order among their tied characters. The GM can decide the order if the tie is between a monster and a player character. Optionally, the GM can have the tied characters and monsters each roll a d20 to determine the order, highest roll going first.</p><h2>Your Turn</h2><p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed and take one action. You decide whether to move first or take your action first. Your speed— sometimes called your walking speed—is noted on your character sheet.</p><p>The most common actions you can take are described in the @UUID[.t0XXMmv014K4vV3p]{Actions in Combat} section. Many class features and other abilities provide additional options for your action.</p><p>The @UUID[.SfmusW5B5jOaR0vd]{Movement and Position} section gives the rules for your move.</p><p>You can forgo moving, taking an action, or doing anything at all on your turn. If you can't decide what to do on your turn, consider taking the Dodge or Ready action, as described in @UUID[.t0XXMmv014K4vV3p]{Actions in Combat}.</p><h3>Bonus Actions</h3><p>Various class features, spells, and other abilities let you take an additional action on your turn called a bonus action. The @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.01pcLg6PRu5zGrsb]{Cunning Action} feature, for example, allows a rogue to take a bonus action. You can take a bonus action only when a special ability, spell, or other feature of the game states that you can do something as a bonus action. You otherwise don't have a bonus action to take.</p><p>You can take only one bonus action on your turn, so you must choose which bonus action to use when you have more than one available.</p><p>You choose when to take a bonus action during your turn, unless the bonus action's timing is specified, and anything that deprives you of your ability to take actions also prevents you from taking a bonus action.</p><h3>Other Activity on Your Turn</h3><p>Your turn can include a variety of flourishes that require neither your action nor your move.</p><p>You can communicate however you are able, through brief utterances and gestures, as you take your turn.</p><p>You can also interact with one object or feature of the environment for free, during either your move or your action. For example, you could open a door during your move as you stride toward a foe, or you could draw your weapon as part of the same action you use to attack.</p><p>If you want to interact with a second object, you need to use your action. Some magic items and other special objects always require an action to use, as stated in their descriptions.</p><p>The GM might require you to use an action for any of these activities when it needs special care or when it presents an unusual obstacle. For instance, the GM could reasonably expect you to use an action to open a stuck door or turn a crank to lower a drawbridge.</p><h2>Reactions</h2><p>Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's. The opportunity attack is the most common type of reaction.</p><p>When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature can continue its turn right after the reaction.</p>"

				"Movement and Position": {
					"name": "Movement and Position",
					"text": "<p>In combat, characters and monsters are in constant motion, often using movement and position to gain the upper hand.</p><p>On your turn, you can move a distance up to your speed. You can use as much or as little of your speed as you like on your turn, following the rules here.</p><p>Your movement can include jumping, climbing, and swimming. These different modes of movement can be combined with walking, or they can constitute your entire move. However you’re moving, you deduct the distance of each part of your move from your speed until it is used up or until you are done moving.</p><h2>Breaking Up Your Move</h2><p>You can break up your movement on your turn, using some of your speed before and after your action. For example, if you have a speed of 30 feet, you can move 10 feet, take your action, and then move 20 feet.</p><h3>Moving between Attacks</h3><p>If you take an action that includes more than one weapon attack, you can break up your movement even further by moving between those attacks. For example, a fighter who can make two attacks with the Extra Attack feature and who has a speed of 25 feet could move 10 feet, make an attack, move 15 feet, and then attack again.</p><h3>Using Different Speeds</h3><p>If you have more than one speed, such as your walking speed and a flying speed, you can switch back and forth between your speeds during your move. Whenever you switch, subtract the distance you’ve already moved from the new speed. The result determines how much farther you can move. If the result is 0 or less, you can’t use the new speed during the current move.</p><p>For example, if you have a speed of 30 and a flying speed of 60 because a wizard cast the fly spell on you, you could fly 20 feet, then walk 10 feet, and then leap into the air to fly 30 feet more.</p><h2>Difficult Terrain</h2><p>Combat rarely takes place in bare rooms or on featureless plains. Boulder-strewn caverns, briarchoked forests, treacherous staircases—the setting of a typical fight contains difficult terrain.</p><p>Every foot of movement in difficult terrain costs 1 extra foot. This rule is true even if multiple things in a space count as difficult terrain.</p><p>Low furniture, rubble, undergrowth, steep stairs, snow, and shallow bogs are examples of difficult terrain. The space of another creature, whether hostile or not, also counts as difficult terrain.</p><h2>Being Prone</h2><p>Combatants often find themselves lying on the ground, either because they are knocked down or because they throw themselves down. In the game, they are @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.y0TkcdyoZlOTmAFT]{Prone}, a condition described in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{Appendix A: Conditions}.</p><p>You can <strong>drop prone</strong> without using any of your speed. <strong>Standing up</strong> takes more effort; doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed.</p><p>For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to stand up. You can’t stand up if you don’t have enough movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>To move while prone, you must <strong>crawl</strong> or use magic such as teleportation. Every foot of movement while crawling costs 1 extra foot. Crawling 1 foot in difficult terrain, therefore, costs 3 feet of movement.</p><hr /><h4>Interacting with Objects Around You</h4><p>Here are a few examples of the sorts of thing you can do in tandem with your movement and action:</p><ul><li>draw or sheathe a sword</li><li>open or close a door</li><li>withdraw a potion from your backpack</li><li>pick up a dropped axe</li><li>take a bauble from a table</li><li>remove a ring from your finger</li><li>stuff some food into your mouth</li><li>plant a banner in the ground</li><li>fish a few coins from your belt pouch</li><li>drink all the ale in a flagon</li><li>throw a lever or a switch</li><li>pull a torch from a sconce</li><li>take a book from a shelf you can reach</li><li>extinguish a small flame</li><li>don a mask</li><li>pull the hood of your cloak up and over your head</li><li>put your ear to a door</li><li>kick a small stone</li><li>turn a key in a lock</li><li>tap the floor with a 10-foot pole</li><li>hand an item to another character</li></ul><hr /><h2>Moving Around Other Creatures</h2><p>You can move through a nonhostile creature’s space. In contrast, you can move through a hostile creature’s space only if the creature is at least two sizes larger or smaller than you. Remember that another creature’s space is difficult terrain for you.</p><p>Whether a creature is a friend or an enemy, you can’t willingly end your move in its space.</p><p>If you leave a hostile creature’s reach during your move, you provoke an opportunity attack.</p><h2>Flying Movement</h2><p>Flying creatures enjoy many benefits of mobility, but they must also deal with the danger of falling. If a flying creature is knocked prone, has its speed reduced to 0, or is otherwise deprived of the ability to move, the creature falls, unless it has the ability to hover or it is being held aloft by magic, such as by the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.yfbK8gZqESlaoY5t]{Fly} spell.</p><h2>Creature Size</h2><p>Each creature takes up a different amount of space. The Size Categories table shows how much space a creature of a particular size controls in combat. Objects sometimes use the same size categories.</p><table border=\"0\"><caption><h4>Size Categories</h4></caption><thead><tr><td>Size</td><td>Space</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Tiny</td><td>2½ by 2½ ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Small</td><td>5 by 5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Medium</td><td>5 by 5 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Large</td><td>10 by 10 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Huge</td><td>15 by 15 ft.</td></tr><tr><td>Gargantuan</td><td>20 by 20 ft. or larger</td></tr></tbody></table><h3>Space</h3><p>A creature’s space is the area in feet that it effectively controls in combat, not an expression of its physical dimensions. A typical Medium creature isn’t 5 feet wide, for example, but it does control a space that wide. If a Medium hobgoblin stands in a 5- foot-wide doorway, other creatures can’t get through unless the hobgoblin lets them.</p><p>A creature’s space also reflects the area it needs to fight effectively. For that reason, there’s a limit to the number of creatures that can surround another creature in combat. Assuming Medium combatants, eight creatures can fit in a 5-foot radius around another one.</p><p>Because larger creatures take up more space, fewer of them can surround a creature. If five Large creatures crowd around a Medium or smaller one, there’s little room for anyone else. In contrast, as many as twenty Medium creatures can surround a Gargantuan one.</p><h3>Squeezing into a Smaller Space</h3><p>A creature can squeeze through a space that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature can squeeze through a passage that’s only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls against the creature have advantage while it’s in the smaller space.</p>"

				"Actions in Combat": {
					"name": "Actions in Combat",
					"text": "<p>When you take your action on your turn, you can take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action options of their own in their stat blocks.</p><p>When you describe an action not detailed elsewhere in the rules, the GM tells you whether that action is possible and what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.</p><h2>Attack</h2><p>The most common action to take in combat is the Attack action, whether you are swinging a sword, firing an arrow from a bow, or brawling with your fists.</p><p>With this action, you make one melee or ranged attack. See the @UUID[.twd4zj7m1n9sBaVG]{Making an Attack} section for the rules that govern attacks.</p><p>Certain features, such as the @Compendium[dnd5e.classfeatures.q9g1MLXuLZyxjQMg]{Extra Attack} feature of the fighter, allow you to make more than one attack with this action.</p><h2>Cast a Spell</h2><p>Spellcasters such as wizards and clerics, as well as many monsters, have access to spells and can use them to great effect in combat. Each spell has a casting time, which specifies whether the caster must use an action, a reaction, minutes, or even hours to cast the spell. Casting a spell is, therefore, not necessarily an action. Most spells do have a casting time of 1 action, so a spellcaster often uses his or her action in combat to cast such a spell.</p><h2>Dash</h2><p>When you take the Dash action, you gain extra movement for the current turn. The increase equals your speed, after applying any modifiers. With a speed of 30 feet, for example, you can move up to 60 feet on your turn if you dash.</p><p>Any increase or decrease to your speed changes this additional movement by the same amount. If your speed of 30 feet is reduced to 15 feet, for instance, you can move up to 30 feet this turn if you dash.</p><h2>Disengage</h2><p>If you take the Disengage action, your movement doesn’t provoke opportunity attacks for the rest of the turn.</p><h2>Dodge</h2><p>When you take the Dodge action, you focus entirely on avoiding attacks. Until the start of your next turn, any attack roll made against you has disadvantage if you can see the attacker, and you make Dexterity saving throws with advantage. You lose this benefit if you are @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.TpkZgLfxCmSndmpb]{Incapacitated} (as explained in @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0]{Appendix A: Conditions}) or if your speed drops to 0.</p><h2>Help</h2><p>You can lend your aid to another creature in the completion of a task. When you take the Help action, the creature you aid gains advantage on the next ability check it makes to perform the task you are helping with, provided that it makes the check before the start of your next turn.</p><p>Alternatively, you can aid a friendly creature in attacking a creature within 5 feet of you. You feint, distract the target, or in some other way team up to make your ally’s attack more effective. If your ally attacks the target before your next turn, the first attack roll is made with advantage.</p><h2>Hide</h2><p>When you take the Hide action, you make a Dexterity (Stealth) check in an attempt to hide, following the rules for hiding. If you succeed, you gain certain benefits, as described in the @UUID[.twd4zj7m1n9sBaVG#unseen-attackers-and-targets]{Unseen Attackers and Targets} section.</p><h2>Ready</h2><p>Sometimes you want to get the jump on a foe or wait for a particular circumstance before you act. To do so, you can take the Ready action on your turn, which lets you act using your reaction before the start of your next turn.</p><p>First, you decide what perceivable circumstance will trigger your reaction. Then, you choose the action you will take in response to that trigger, or you choose to move up to your speed in response to it. Examples include “If the cultist steps on the trapdoor, I’ll pull the lever that opens it,” and “If the goblin steps next to me, I move away.”</p><p>When the trigger occurs, you can either take your reaction right after the trigger finishes or ignore the trigger. Remember that you can take only one reaction per round.</p><p>When you ready a spell, you cast it as normal but hold its energy, which you release with your reaction when the trigger occurs. To be readied, a spell must have a casting time of 1 action, and holding onto the spell’s magic requires concentration. If your concentration is broken, the spell dissipates without taking effect. For example, if you are concentrating on the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.UJJu9c2UvCzVljiP]{Web} spell and ready @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.41JIhpDyM9Anm7cs]{Magic Missile}, your Web spell ends, and if you take damage before you release Magic Missile with your reaction, your concentration might be broken.</p><h2>Search</h2><p>When you take the Search action, you devote your attention to finding something. Depending on the nature of your search, the GM might have you make a Wisdom (Perception) check or an Intelligence (Investigation) check.</p><h2>Use an Object</h2><p>You normally interact with an object while doing something else, such as when you draw a sword as part of an attack. When an object requires your action for its use, you take the Use an Object action. This action is also useful when you want to interact with more than one object on your turn.</p>"

				"Making an Attack": {
					"name": "Making an Attack",
					"text": "<p>Whether you're striking with a melee weapon, firing a weapon at range, or making an attack roll as part of a spell, an attack has a simple structure.</p><ol><li><strong>Choose a target. </strong>Pick a target within your attack's range: a creature, an object, or a location.</li><li><strong>Determine modifiers.</strong> The GM determines whether the target has cover and whether you have advantage or disadvantage against the target. In addition, spells, special abilities, and other effects can apply penalties or bonuses to your attack roll.</li><li><strong>Resolve the attack. </strong>You make the attack roll. On a hit, you roll damage, unless the particular attack has rules that specify otherwise. Some attacks cause special effects in addition to or instead of damage.</li></ol><p>If there's ever any question whether something you're doing counts as an attack, the rule is simple: if you're making an attack roll, you're making an attack.</p><h2>Attack Rolls</h2><p>When you make an attack, your attack roll determines whether the attack hits or misses. To make an attack roll, roll a d20 and add the appropriate modifiers. If the total of the roll plus modifiers equals or exceeds the target's Armor Class (AC), the attack hits. The AC of a character is determined at character creation, whereas the AC of a monster is in its stat block.</p><h3>Modifiers to the Roll</h3><p>When a character makes an attack roll, the two most common modifiers to the roll are an ability modifier and the character's proficiency bonus. When a monster makes an attack roll, it uses whatever modifier is provided in its stat block.</p><p><strong>Ability Modifier. </strong>The ability modifier used for a melee weapon attack is Strength, and the ability modifier used for a ranged weapon attack is Dexterity. Weapons that have the finesse or thrown property break this rule.</p><p>Some spells also require an attack roll. The ability modifier used for a spell attack depends on the spellcasting ability of the spellcaster.</p><p><strong>Proficiency Bonus.</strong> You add your proficiency bonus to your attack roll when you attack using a weapon with which you have proficiency, as well as when you attack with a spell.</p><h3>Rolling 1 or 20</h3><p>Sometimes fate blesses or curses a combatant, causing the novice to hit and the veteran to miss.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 20, the attack hits regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC. This is called a critical hit.</p><p>If the d20 roll for an attack is a 1, the attack misses regardless of any modifiers or the target's AC.</p><h2>Unseen Attackers and Targets</h2><p>Combatants often try to escape their foes' notice by hiding, casting the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.1N8dDMMgZ1h1YJ3B]{invisibility} spell, or lurking in darkness.</p><p>When you attack a target that you can't see, you have disadvantage on the attack roll. This is true whether you're guessing the target's location or you're targeting a creature you can hear but not see. If the target isn't in the location you targeted, you automatically miss, but the GM typically just says that the attack missed, not whether you guessed the target's location correctly.</p><p>When a creature can't see you, you have advantage on attack rolls against it. If you are hidden—both unseen and unheard—when you make an attack, you give away your location when the attack hits or misses.</p><h2>Ranged Attacks</h2><p>When you make a ranged attack, you fire a bow or a crossbow, hurl a handaxe, or otherwise send projectiles to strike a foe at a distance. A monster might shoot spines from its tail. Many spells also involve making a ranged attack.</p><h3>Range</h3><p>You can make ranged attacks only against targets within a specified range.</p><p>If a ranged attack, such as one made with a spell, has a single range, you can't attack a target beyond this range.</p><p>Some ranged attacks, such as those made with a longbow or a shortbow, have two ranges. The smaller number is the normal range, and the larger number is the long range. Your attack roll has disadvantage when your target is beyond normal range, and you can't attack a target beyond the long range.</p><h3>Ranged Attacks in Close Combat</h3><p>Aiming a ranged attack is more difficult when a foe is next to you. When you make a ranged attack with a weapon, a spell, or some other means, you have disadvantage on the attack roll if you are within 5 feet of a hostile creature who can see you and who isn't incapacitated.</p><h2>Melee Attacks</h2><p>Used in hand-to-hand combat, a melee attack allows you to attack a foe within your reach. A melee attack typically uses a handheld weapon such as a sword, a warhammer, or an axe. A typical monster makes a melee attack when it strikes with its claws, horns, teeth, tentacles, or other body part. A few spells also involve making a melee attack.</p><p>Most creatures have a 5-foot <strong>reach</strong> and can thus attack targets within 5 feet of them when making a melee attack. Certain creatures (typically those larger than Medium) have melee attacks with a greater reach than 5 feet, as noted in their descriptions.</p><p>Instead of using a weapon to make a melee weapon attack, you can use an <strong>unarmed strike</strong>: a punch, kick, head-butt, or similar forceful blow (none of which count as weapons). On a hit, an unarmed strike deals bludgeoning damage equal to 1 + your Strength modifier. You are proficient with your unarmed strikes.</p><h3>Opportunity Attacks</h3><p>In a fight, everyone is constantly watching for a chance to strike an enemy who is fleeing or passing by. Such a strike is called an opportunity attack.</p><p>You can make an opportunity attack when a hostile creature that you can see moves out of your reach. To make the opportunity attack, you use your reaction to make one melee attack against the provoking creature. The attack occurs right before the creature leaves your reach.</p><p>You can avoid provoking an opportunity attack by taking the Disengage action. You also don't provoke an opportunity attack when you teleport or when someone or something moves you without using your movement, action, or reaction. For example, you don't provoke an opportunity attack if an explosion hurls you out of a foe's reach or if gravity causes you to fall past an enemy.</p><h3>Two-Weapon Fighting</h3><p>When you take the Attack action and attack with a light melee weapon that you're holding in one hand, you can use a bonus action to attack with a different light melee weapon that you're holding in the other hand. You don't add your ability modifier to the damage of the bonus attack, unless that modifier is negative.</p><p>If either weapon has the thrown property, you can throw the weapon, instead of making a melee attack with it.</p><h3>Grappling</h3><p>When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try to seize the target by making a grapple check instead of an attack roll: a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see appendix PH-A). The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target whenever you like (no action required).</p><p><strong>Escaping a Grapple. </strong>A grappled creature can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.</p><p><strong>Moving a Grappled Creature. </strong>When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes smaller than you.</p><hr /><h4>Contests in Combat</h4><p>Battle often involves pitting your prowess against that of your foe. Such a challenge is represented by a contest. This section includes the most common contests that require an action in combat: grappling and shoving a creature. The GM can use these contests as models for improvising others.</p><hr /><h3>Shoving a Creature</h3><p>Using the Attack action, you can make a special melee attack to shove a creature, either to knock it prone or push it away from you. If you're able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them.</p><p>The target must be no more than one size larger than you and must be within your reach. Instead of making an attack roll, you make a Strength (Athletics) check contested by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target chooses the ability to use). If you win the contest, you either knock the target prone or push it 5 feet away from you.</p>"
				},
				"Cover": {
					"name": "Cover",
					"text": "<p>Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of the cover.</p><p>There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters cover.</p><p>A target with<strong> half cover </strong>has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk, or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend.</p><p>A target with <strong>three-quarters cover</strong> has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk.</p><p>A target with <strong>total cover </strong>can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.</p>"

				"Damage and Healing":{
					"name": "Damage and Healing",
					"text": "<p>Injury and the risk of death are constant companions of those who explore fantasy gaming worlds. The thrust of a sword, a well-placed arrow, or a blast of flame from a fireball spell all have the potential to damage, or even kill, the hardiest of creatures.</p><h2>Hit Points</h2><p>Hit points represent a combination of physical and mental durability, the will to live, and luck. Creatures with more hit points are more difficult to kill. Those with fewer hit points are more fragile.</p><p>A creature’s current hit points (usually just called hit points) can be any number from the creature’s hit point maximum down to 0. This number changes frequently as a creature takes damage or receives healing.</p><p>Whenever a creature takes damage, that damage is subtracted from its hit points. The loss of hit points has no effect on a creature’s capabilities until the creature drops to 0 hit points.</p><h2>Damage Rolls</h2><p>Each weapon, spell, and harmful monster ability specifies the damage it deals. You roll the damage die or dice, add any modifiers, and apply the damage to your target. Magic weapons, special abilities, and other factors can grant a bonus to damage. With a penalty, it is possible to deal 0 damage, but never negative damage.</p><p>When attacking with a <strong>weapon</strong>, you add your ability modifier—the same modifier used for the attack roll—to the damage. A <strong>spell</strong> tells you which dice to roll for damage and whether to add any modifiers.</p><p>If a spell or other effect deals damage to <strong>more than one target </strong>at the same time, roll the damage once for all of them. For example, when a wizard casts @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.ztgcdrWPshKRpFd0]{Fireball} or a cleric casts @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.5e1xTohkzqFqbYH4]{Flame Strike}, the spell’s damage is rolled once for all creatures caught in the blast.</p><h3>Critical Hits</h3><p>When you score a critical hit, you get to roll extra dice for the attack’s damage against the target. Roll all of the attack’s damage dice twice and add them together. Then add any relevant modifiers as normal. To speed up play, you can roll all the damage dice at once.</p><p>For example, if you score a critical hit with a dagger, roll 2d4 for the damage, rather than 1d4, and then add your relevant ability modifier. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the rogue’s Sneak Attack feature, you roll those dice twice as well.</p><h3>Damage Types</h3><p>Different attacks, damaging spells, and other harmful effects deal different types of damage. Damage types have no rules of their own, but other rules, such as damage resistance, rely on the types.</p><p>The damage types follow, with examples to help a GM assign a damage type to a new effect.</p><p><strong>Acid. </strong>The corrosive spray of a black dragon’s breath and the dissolving enzymes secreted by a black pudding deal acid damage.</p><p><strong>Bludgeoning. </strong>Blunt force attacks—hammers, falling, constriction, and the like—deal bludgeoning damage.</p><p><strong>Cold. </strong>The infernal chill radiating from an ice devil’s spear and the frigid blast of a white dragon’s breath deal cold damage.</p><p><strong>Fire. </strong>Red dragons breathe fire, and many spells conjure flames to deal fire damage.</p><p><strong>Force. </strong>Force is pure magical energy focused into a damaging form. Most effects that deal force damage are spells, including magic missile and spiritual weapon.</p><p><strong>Lightning. </strong>A lightning bolt spell and a blue dragon’s breath deal lightning damage.</p><p><strong>Necrotic. </strong>Necrotic damage, dealt by certain undead and a spell such as chill touch, withers matter and even the soul.</p><p><strong>Piercing.</strong> Puncturing and impaling attacks, including spears and monsters’ bites, deal piercing damage.</p><p><strong>Poison. </strong>Venomous stings and the toxic gas of a green dragon’s breath deal poison damage.</p><p><strong>Psychic. </strong>Mental abilities such as a mind flayer’s psionic blast deal psychic damage.</p><p><strong>Radiant. </strong>Radiant damage, dealt by a cleric’s flame strike spell or an angel’s smiting weapon, sears the flesh like fire and overloads the spirit with power.</p><p><strong>Slashing. </strong>Swords, axes, and monsters’ claws deal slashing damage.</p><p><strong>Thunder. </strong>A concussive burst of sound, such as the effect of the thunderwave spell, deals thunder damage.</p><h2>Damage Resistance and Vulnerability</h2><p>Some creatures and objects are exceedingly difficult or unusually easy to hurt with certain types of damage.</p><p>If a creature or an object has <strong>resistance</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is halved against it. If a creature or an object has <strong>vulnerability</strong> to a damage type, damage of that type is doubled against it.</p><p>Resistance and then vulnerability are applied after all other modifiers to damage. For example, a creature has resistance to bludgeoning damage and is hit by an attack that deals 25 bludgeoning damage. The creature is also within a magical aura that reduces all damage by 5. The 25 damage is first reduced by 5 and then halved, so the creature takes 10 damage.</p><p>Multiple instances of resistance or vulnerability that affect the same damage type count as only one instance. For example, if a creature has resistance to fire damage as well as resistance to all nonmagical damage, the damage of a nonmagical fire is reduced by half against the creature, not reduced by threequarters.</p><h2>Healing</h2><p>Unless it results in death, damage isn’t permanent. Even death is reversible through powerful magic. Rest can restore a creature’s hit points, and magical methods such as a @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.uUWb1wZgtMou0TVP]{Cure Wounds} spell or a @Compendium[dnd5e.items.ytlsBjYsZ7OBSEBs]{Potion of Healing} can remove damage in an instant.</p><p>When a creature receives healing of any kind, hit points regained are added to its current hit points. A creature’s hit points can’t exceed its hit point maximum, so any hit points regained in excess of this number are lost. For example, a druid grants a ranger 8 hit points of healing. If the ranger has 14 current hit points and has a hit point maximum of 20, the ranger regains 6 hit points from the druid, not 8.</p><p>A creature that has died can’t regain hit points until magic such as the @Compendium[dnd5e.spells.LmRHHMtplpxr9fX6]{Revivify} spell has restored it to life.</p><h2>Dropping to 0 Hit Points</h2><p>When you drop to 0 hit points, you either die outright or fall unconscious, as explained in the following sections.</p><h3>Instant Death</h3><p>Massive damage can kill you instantly. When damage reduces you to 0 hit points and there is damage remaining, you die if the remaining damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum.</p><p>For example, a cleric with a maximum of 12 hit points currently has 6 hit points. If she takes 18 damage from an attack, she is reduced to 0 hit points, but 12 damage remains. Because the remaining damage equals her hit point maximum, the cleric dies.</p><h3>Falling Unconscious</h3><p>If damage reduces you to 0 hit points and fails to kill you, you fall @UUID[Compendium.dnd5e.rules.w7eitkpD7QQTB6j0.JournalEntryPage.UWw13ISmMxDzmwbd]{Unconscious}. This unconsciousness ends if you regain any hit points.</p><h3>Death Saving Throws</h3><p>Whenever you start your turn with 0 hit points, you must make a special saving throw, called a death saving throw, to determine whether you creep closer to death or hang onto life. Unlike other saving throws, this one isn’t tied to any ability score. You are in the hands of fate now, aided only by spells and features that improve your chances of succeeding on a saving throw.</p><p>Roll a d20. If the roll is 10 or higher, you succeed. Otherwise, you fail. A success or failure has no effect by itself. On your third success, you become stable (see below). On your third failure, you die. The successes and failures don’t need to be consecutive; keep track of both until you collect three of a kind. The number of both is reset to zero when you regain any hit points or become stable.</p><p><strong>Rolling 1 or 20. </strong>When you make a death saving throw and roll a 1 on the d20, it counts as two failures. If you roll a 20 on the d20, you regain 1 hit point.</p><p><strong>Damage at 0 Hit Points. </strong>If you take any damage while you have 0 hit points, you suffer a death saving throw failure. If the damage is from a critical hit, you suffer two failures instead. If the damage equals or exceeds your hit point maximum, you suffer instant death.</p><h3>Stabilizing a Creature</h3><p>The best way to save a creature with 0 hit points is to heal it. If healing is unavailable, the creature can at least be stabilized so that it isn’t killed by a failed death saving throw.</p><p>You can use your action to administer first aid to an unconscious creature and attempt to stabilize it, which requires a successful DC 10 Wisdom (Medicine) check.</p><p>A <strong>stable</strong> creature doesn’t make death saving throws, even though it has 0 hit points, but it does remain unconscious. The creature stops being stable, and must start making death saving throws again, if it takes any damage. A stable creature that isn’t healed regains 1 hit point after 1d4 hours.</p><h3>Monsters and Death</h3><p>Most GMs have a monster die the instant it drops to 0 hit points, rather than having it fall unconscious and make death saving throws.</p><p>Mighty villains and special nonplayer characters are common exceptions; the GM might have them fall unconscious and follow the same rules as player characters.</p><h2>Knocking a Creature Out</h2><p>Sometimes an attacker wants to incapacitate a foe, rather than deal a killing blow. When an attacker reduces a creature to 0 hit points with a melee attack, the attacker can knock the creature out. The attacker can make this choice the instant the damage is dealt. The creature falls unconscious and is stable.</p><h2>Temporary Hit Points</h2><p>Some spells and special abilities confer temporary hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren’t actual hit points; they are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.</p><p>When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points. For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the temporary hit points and then take 2 damage.</p><p>Because temporary hit points are separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum. A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.</p><p>Healing can’t restore temporary hit points, and they can’t be added together. If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10, not 22.</p><p>If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn’t restore you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed at you while you’re in that state, but only true healing can save you.</p><p>Unless a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until they’re depleted or you finish a long rest.</p>"

					"text": "<p>A knight charging into battle on a warhorse, a wizard casting spells from the back of a griffon, or a cleric soaring through the sky on a pegasus all enjoy the benefits of speed and mobility that a mount can provide.</p><p>A willing creature that is at least one size larger than you and that has an appropriate anatomy can serve as a mount, using the following rules.</p><h2>Mounting and Dismounting</h2><p>Once during your move, you can mount a creature that is within 5 feet of you or dismount. Doing so costs an amount of movement equal to half your speed. For example, if your speed is 30 feet, you must spend 15 feet of movement to mount a horse. Therefore, you can't mount it if you don't have 15 feet of movement left or if your speed is 0.</p><p>If an effect moves your mount against its will while you're on it, you must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or fall off the mount, landing prone in a space within 5 feet of it. If you're knocked prone while mounted, you must make the same saving throw.</p><p>If your mount is knocked prone, you can use your reaction to dismount it as it falls and land on your feet. Otherwise, you are dismounted and fall prone in a space within 5 feet it.</p><h2>Controlling a Mount</h2><p>While you're mounted, you have two options. You can either control the mount or allow it to act independently. Intelligent creatures, such as dragons, act independently.</p><p>You can control a mount only if it has been trained to accept a rider. Domesticated horses, donkeys, and similar creatures are assumed to have such training. The initiative of a controlled mount changes to match yours when you mount it. It moves as you direct it, and it has only three action options: Dash, Disengage, and Dodge. A controlled mount can move and act even on the turn that you mount it.</p><p>An independent mount retains its place in the initiative order. Bearing a rider puts no restrictions on the actions the mount can take, and it moves and acts as it wishes. It might flee from combat, rush to attack and devour a badly injured foe, or otherwise act against your wishes.</p><p>In either case, if the mount provokes an opportunity attack while you're on it, the attacker can target you or the mount.</p>"
